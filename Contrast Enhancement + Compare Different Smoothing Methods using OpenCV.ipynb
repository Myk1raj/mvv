    "    #### The Averaging filter produced a very blurry image. While it reduced noise, it also caused a significant loss of detail, making the image look overly smooth and washed out. The edges, especially around the building and the plane, became less sharp.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Gaussian Blur showed a more natural smoothing effect compared to the averaging method. The noise was reduced effectively, but some fine details were still visible. However, the edges were still slightly blurred, making it less ideal for applications requiring sharp boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Median filter performed well in noise reduction, particularly for salt-and-pepper noise. Unlike the averaging and Gaussian methods, it preserved edges better. The details of the building were clearer compared to the previous two methods, though the overall image still looked somewhat softened.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Bilateral filter provided the best balance between noise reduction and edge preservation. While it smoothed the background and sky effectively, the edges of the building and plane remained sharp. This method retained more details compared to the other filters, making it the most visually appealing for preserving structural elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary, while all the methods reduced noise, the bilateral filter maintained edges best, whereas the averaging and Gaussian methods introduced more blurring. The median filter was effective for noise removal without excessive blurring, making it a good middle ground.\n",

    "- **Advantage:** Simple and effective for removing random noise.  \n",
    "- **Disadvantage:** Blurs edges and fine details, leading to loss of sharpness.  \n",

    "- **Advantage:** Provides better noise reduction while maintaining some details.  \n",
    "- **Disadvantage:** Still causes edge blurring, though less severe than the averaging filter.  \n",
