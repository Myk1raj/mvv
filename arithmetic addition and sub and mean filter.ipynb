    "##### When performing image addition, the visual results differ significantly between using OpenCV and a manual approach without it. Without OpenCV, pixel values are added directly using NumPy, and the resulting values are manually clipped to stay within the valid range of 0 to 255. This is leading to oversaturation in brighter areas, making the image appear unnaturally bright and distorted in terms of color. On the other hand, when using OpenCV’s cv2.add function, the addition is handled more naturally. Bright regions are being blended more seamlessly as the function automatically caps pixel values, preventing abrupt transitions or distortions. This is resulting in a more visually balanced and realistic output.\n",

    "##### In the case of image subtraction, the differences are equally noticeable. Using NumPy for subtraction is producing harsh transitions, as negative pixel values are clipped to zero manually, often leading to sharp contrasts and abrupt changes in darker areas. This is making the image look less natural and sometimes overly stark. With OpenCV’s cv2.subtract function, the underflow is managed gracefully, with negative results automatically set to zero. This is creating smoother transitions and highlights differences more effectively, producing an output that is easier to interpret and visually more appealing.\n",
